# Brain Tumor Detection - Deep Learning Model

This repository is made for a college project and is **NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE**.

To anyone who wonders what this is about, it's a basic deep learning project that detects brain tumors in MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes:

- A CNN model trained to classify MRI images as either showing a tumor or not.
- A Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) to upload and classify images.
- Image preprocessing using OpenCV and PIL.

The model was trained using a dataset of MRI images, and the final model is saved in the `brain_tumor_detection_model.h5` file.

### Features:
- Detects brain tumors from MRI images using a trained deep learning model.
- Easy-to-use interface for image upload and result display.
- Built using TensorFlow/Keras for model training and OpenCV for image processing.

**This application was made by a _Rookie_ programmer, so it is bound to have numerous flaws. No clean architecture techniques were adopted.**

**To anyone who wants to use the project, I've made this in Python 3.x with TensorFlow 2.x, Keras, and Tkinter for the GUI.**

### Requirements:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- PIL (Pillow)
- scikit-learn
- Tkinter (included with Python)
